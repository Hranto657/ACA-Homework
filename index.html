          is known for portraying characters in various action-thriller films
          who are typically tough, gritty, or violent. Statham has been credited
          for leading the resurgence of action films during the 2000s and
          2010s.His film career through 2017 generated over $1.5 billion (£1.1
          billion) in ticket sales, making him one of the film industry's most
          bankable stars.

        <p>
          <span>Statham</span> began practising Chinese martial arts,
          kickboxing, and karate recreationally in his youth while working at
          local market stalls. An avid footballer and diver, he was a member of
          Britain's national diving team and competed for England in the 1990
          Commonwealth Games. Shortly after, he was asked to model for French
          Connection, Tommy Hilfiger, and Levi's in various advertising
          campaigns. His past history working at market stalls inspired his
          casting in the Guy Ritchie crime films Lock, Stock and Two Smoking
          Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000).
        </p>

          <span>The Mechanic (2011)</span>, <span>Spy (2015)</span> and
          <span>Mechanic: Resurrection (2016)</span>.He established himself as a
          Hollywood leading man. However, he has also starred in commercially
          and critically unsuccessful films such as
          <span>Revolver (2005)</span>,<span>Chaos (2005)</span>,

          part of the ensemble action series The Expendables (2010–2014) and the

          <span>Jason Statham</span> was born on 26 July 1967 in Shirebrook,
          Derbyshire,the son of dancer Eileen (née Yates) and street seller
          Barry Statham.His father also worked odd jobs as a house painter, coal
          miner, and singer in the Canary Islands.Statham moved to Great
          Yarmouth, Norfolk, where he initially chose not to follow his father's
          career working the local market stalls, instead practising martial
          arts. He grew up with football player Vinnie Jones, alongside whom he
          would later act. Jones introduced him to football, and Statham went on
          to play for the local grammar school (1978–1983), which he had
          attended since age 11, a passion that he shared with diving.He
          practised daily in perfecting his diving techniques, and was a member
          of Britain's National Swimming Squad for 12 years. He competed for
          England at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in the 10 metre, 3 metre, and 1
          metre competitions.He said in a 2003 interview with IGN that his time
          with the national squad was "a great experience" and one that "teaches
          you discipline, focus, and certainly keeps you out of trouble".

      <h1>Career</h1>
      <h2>2000–2010: Rise to prominence</h2>
      <p>
        While working as a model for French Connection, he was introduced to
        fledgling British director Guy Ritchie who was developing a film project
        and needed to fill the role of a street-wise con artist. After learning
        about Statham's past as a black market salesman, Ritchie cast him to
        play the role of "Bacon" in his 1998 crime comedy thriller Lock, Stock
        and Two Smoking Barrels.The movie was well received by both critics and
        audiences, and helped put Statham in the public eye. For his role in the
        film he was paid UK £5,000.Statham's second collaboration with Ritchie
        came in the 2000 film Snatch, playing the role of "Turkish". Cast
        alongside popular actors Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina, and Benicio del Toro,
        the movie earned more than $80 million in box-office revenue. For his
        role in Snatch, he was paid UK £15,000, 3 times the amount of his first
        film.Statham was able to break into Hollywood and appeared in two movies
        in 2001: the science fiction action horror film Ghosts of Mars and the
        science fiction martial arts action film The One.
      </p>
      <p>
        Statham was offered more film roles, and in 2002 he was cast as the lead
        role of driver Frank Martin in the action movie The Transporter, written
        by Luc Besson. He has studied Wing Chun, karate, and kickboxing.The film
        spawned two sequels, Transporter 2 (2005) and Transporter 3 (2008). He
        also played supporting roles in Mean Machine (2002), The Italian Job
        (2003),and Cellular (2004) in which he played the lead villain.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2005, Statham was once again cast by Ritchie to star in his new
        project, Revolver, which was a critical and box office failure.He played
        a dramatic role in the independent film London in 2006. That same year
        he played the lead role in the action film Crank. Statham was asked to
        promote Crank during the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con Convention.In 2008,
        Statham starred in the British crime thriller The Bank Job and Death
        Race, a remake of Death Race 2000 (1975). American film critic Armond
        White hailed Statham's ascension as an action film star. On the occasion
        of Death Race, White championed Statham's "best track record of any
        contemporary movie star."Later in 2008, White praised Statham's
        Transporter 3 as a great example of kinetic pop art. Chris Hewitt of
        Empire Magazine, noted the film as "a dour, drab affair", but credited
        the film with "establishing Statham as a new action hero, as at ease
        with gruff one-liners as he was with Jackie Chan-esque high-kicking".
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2009, Statham started to develop a new movie written by David Peoples
        and Janet Peoples. Statham stated "We've got a movie we're trying to do,
        written by David Peoples and Janet Peoples, in the vein of an old film,
        The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. It's not a remake or anything, but
        it's a little bit like that, about relationships and how greed
        contaminates the relationships these three people have. The working
        title is The Grabbers."He reprised his role as Chev Chelios in the 2009
        sequel Crank: High Voltage.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2010, Statham appeared alongside fellow action stars Sylvester
        Stallone, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren and Mickey Rourke, among others, in the
        ensemble action film The Expendables. Statham plays Lee Christmas, a
        former SAS soldier and expert at close quarters combat using knives. The
        film was commercially successful, opening at number one at the box
        office in the United States, the United Kingdom, China and India, and
        grossed a total of $274 million worldwide.
